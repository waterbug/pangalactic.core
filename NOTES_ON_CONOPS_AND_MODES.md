* The PGEF ConOps (Concept of Operations) Modeler is used to define an
  "Activity Model" of a mission or subset of mission operations.  The ConOps
  module in PGEF supports the analysis of the power requirements of an
  observatory or spacecraft to enable sizing the components of the electrical
  power subsystem (solar array, batteries, etc.).

* Power Modes:  A power mode is a state of a system or component in which an
  average power consumption can be specified.

* Activities:  An activity is an occurrence (with a start time and a duration)
  of a system being in a specified state (power mode).
